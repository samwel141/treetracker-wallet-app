## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

### 🚀 Overview

Added comprehensive end-to-end testing using **WebdriverIO** for the wallet
application, covering:

- ✅ **Login flow** (success & failure cases)
- ✅ **Wallet creation** process
- ✅ **User registration** workflow
- ✅ **HTML test reports** with detailed execution analysis
- ✅ **Video recordings** for debugging failed tests
- and more

---

### 🧪 Test Commands

Run these from the repository root:

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
yarn bdd:e2e

# Run specific test suite
yarn bdd:e2e:login
yarn bdd:e2e:register
yarn bdd:e2e:wallet

# Debug mode (verbose output)
yarn bdd:e2e:debug

# Update ChromeDriver (if tests fail)
yarn bdd:e2e:update-driver

# Generate HTML test reports
yarn bdd:report          # Generate HTML report from existing test results
yarn bdd:test:report     # Run tests + generate HTML report
```

---

### 🖼️ Test Evidence

Sample Output:

![Sample Output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/456c64cf-b92f-4030-bf96-7b56bfdaa800)

```bash
$ yarn test:e2e
[chrome] ✔ Login - Valid credentials (4.2s)
[chrome] ✔ Wallet Creation - Basic flow (6.1s)
[chrome] ✔ Registration - Email signup (5.8s)
```

**HTML Test Reports:**

- Detailed execution analysis with pass/fail status
- Video recordings for debugging failed tests
- Browser metadata and execution timing
- Generated in `apps/bdd/reports/cucumber-html/index.html`

---

### ✅ Verification Checklist

- All tests pass locally (`yarn test:e2e`)
- HTML reports generated successfully (`yarn bdd:report`)
- Video recordings captured for failed tests
- No production code modified
- Test data follows PII guidelines
- ChromeDriver version (v136) matches CI
- Documentation updated if needed

---

### ⚠️ Requirements

The backend must be running for the tests to function. You can start it with:

```bash
yarn workspace web dev
```

Also, ensure you have Chrome v136+ installed.

### How to develop BDD E2E test

A recommended way to develop e2e test by practicing TDD method, basically it use
watch mode to auto-rerun the test once you changed the file, and use the
browser.debug() to set stop point, so you can enter the REPL mode to try and
verify things.

About [REPL](https://webdriver.io/docs/repl).

Now assume that we will deploy a scenario of create wallet, run command:

```bash
cd apps/bdd
npx wdio run ./wdio.debug.conf.ts --watch  --spec ./features/create-wallet.feature:26
```

The `wdio.debug.conf.ts` has some settings that are convenient for debug, longer
timeout, no headless mode, etc.

Use `--spec` to specify the file of feature, and the line of the scenario, so
only this scenario will be run.

Now it will run the scenario and finish it, but still keep the window open, you
can modify the scenario then save it, the test will be re-run automatically.

When the test run to the `browser.debug()` line, it will pause and enter the
REPL mode, you can try commands in the terminal, now you can run any webdriverIO
command to verify things, see doc here: https://webdriver.io/docs/api

NOTE, there are still some problem with this approach:

1. The WebdriverIO watch mode can not JUST monitor the feature files, that
   means, if you want to rerun the test, you have to save or `touch` the feature
   file to trigger rerun.
   [Reason](https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/wdio-qunit-service/issues/42)

2. If stop at `browser.debug()`, then you can not re-run directly, you need to
   quit (by ctrl+c) the REPL mode, then save the feature file to trigger rerun.

```


## Commit hooks and test behavior

We run `lint-staged` on commit to keep commits fast. Heavy integration/unit/e2e
tests are not run during commit — they run in CI on pull requests instead.

Note: this repository uses Yarn v4 via Corepack. If you see a message about
Yarn versions, run:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare yarn@4.9.4 --activate
yarn -v  # should show a Yarn 4.x version
```

## How to set up: lint, code format, Typescript for a new package/app

Follow this PR too add shared configuration package to standardize linting,
formatting, and TypeScript setup across the project.
